Doing the official Django Tutorial from: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/intro/tutorial01/

This is the second Django project i'm creating, as i want to be more comfortable with the basics.
(Initial tutorial i followed was by Corey Schafer, still recommend, however repetition never hurts).

I am also using this as a boiler-plate to learn REST APIs, and namely Djangos "Rest Framework". 

- https://www.django-rest-framework.org/


Additionally:

- I am using Pythons UV to handle dependencies and the VENV for the project.
- I will be integrating an API (Weather APP) as practice for 3rd party APIs.

Update 13/06:

- I have completed both the original tutorials (1-6) at: https://www.django-rest-framework.org/tutorial/1-serialization/ as well as the quickstart: https://www.django-rest-framework.org/tutorial/quickstart/
