Doing the official Django Tutorial from: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/intro/tutorial01/

This is the second Django project i'm creating, as i want to be more comfortable with the basics.
(Initial tutorial i followed was by Corey Schafer, still recommend, however repetition never hurts).

Additionally:
    - I am using Pythons UV to handle dependencies and the VENV for the project.
    - I am learning and starting a test DRF project according to the official docs: https://www.django-rest-framework.org/tutorial/quickstart/
    - I will be integrating an API (Weather APP) as practice for 3rd party APIs.
